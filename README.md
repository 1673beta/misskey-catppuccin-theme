# TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS

> **Note:** feel free to remove this section after reading it üòé

## üêß Usage

There are this things on GitHub called "template repositories" which you can use as blueprints for a new repo. The problem with this is that they leave a _small_ tag under the repos' name that says "generated from <template>". To avoid this follow these instructions:

1. Create the repo and leave it empty
2. Add this template as a remote: `git remote add template git@github.com:catppuccin/template.git`
3. Pull from it: `git remote pull template`
4. Delete the remote: `git remote remove template`

## ü§© Style

- The name of the repo must be the simplest version of the app's name (e.g `nvim` instead of `NeoVim`)
- Format repo description as "Catppuccin theme for AwesomeApp"
- Uppercase meta files (e.g. `README.md`)
- Don't add health files (like `CODE_OF_CONDUCTS` or `SUPPORT`), those are organization-wide files stored [here](https://github.com/catppuccin/.github).
- Emojis are _the way_, feel free to use them as much as you want.
